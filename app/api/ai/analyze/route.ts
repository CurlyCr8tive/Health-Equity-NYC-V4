**COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**
Please provide an in-depth, actionable analysis that EXPLICITLY MENTIONS AND INTEGRATES ALL THREE DATA SOURCES with the following sections:

## 1. MULTI-SOURCE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- Synthesize findings from CDC, EpiQuery, and NYC Open Data
- Highlight how different data sources complement each other
- Identify data gaps and limitations across sources

## 2. INTEGRATED HEALTH DISPARITIES ANALYSIS
- Combine CDC surveillance data with local EpiQuery profiles
- Use NYC Open Data to understand infrastructure impacts
- Cross-reference findings across all three sources

## 3. COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT
- EpiQuery environmental indicators analysis
- NYC Open Data infrastructure and service mapping
- CDC environmental health correlations

## 4. MULTI-SOURCE COMMUNITY INTERVENTION STRATEGY
### Based on CDC Data:
- Evidence-based interventions from federal surveillance
- Population-level prevention strategies

### Based on EpiQuery Data:
- Neighborhood-specific community health approaches
- Local environmental health interventions

### Based on NYC Open Data:
- Infrastructure and service enhancement opportunities
- Municipal resource optimization strategies

## 5. INTEGRATED RESOURCE MAPPING
- Healthcare facilities (NYC Open Data)
- Community health indicators (EpiQuery)
- Population health trends (CDC)

## 6. COMPREHENSIVE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
- Federal policy alignment (CDC data insights)
- Local policy priorities (EpiQuery findings)
- Municipal service improvements (NYC Open Data analysis)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** 
Your analysis MUST explicitly reference and integrate findings from all three data sources (CDC, EpiQuery, NYC Open Data) throughout. Do not focus on just one source - this is a comprehensive multi-source analysis.

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Clearly identify which insights come from which data source
- Show how the three sources complement and validate each other
- Highlight any contradictions or gaps between sources
- Provide source-specific recommendations
- Create an integrated action plan using all available data

Be comprehensive, specific, and actionable. This multi-source analysis will guide real community health interventions in ${location}.`
